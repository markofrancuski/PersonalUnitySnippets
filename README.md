Personal snippets for developing unity applications inside the visual studio

This is my personal snippets that i use when developing in Unity.
For TimingCoroutines you need to download 'More Effective Coroutines' from unity assets store.

To use snippets inside visual studio, go to Tools -> Code Snippet Manager -> Choose Import -> Select folder with snippets. Voila you saved yourself time.
